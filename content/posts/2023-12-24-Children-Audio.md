The first electronic device which a young child autonomously uses, is most likely an audio device to chose their own music or stories. I am in my mid 30s now and we used cassette tapes, which we were pretty much a common standard back then. Nowadays multiple different licensing methods exists. Tonies, Kekz, Jooki, Coins, you name it. Every company has their own methods and ways to store, encrypt and work with audio files. Most of the times, they don't intertwine. You don't buy the content, you buy the license to play the content. If your player dies, your content is gone as well.

I've recently become a parent, and I think this **sucks**.

The upcoming blog series aims to uncover the complex world of children's audio devices, revealing how reverse engineering can lead to a more complex use of the items and probably a way to fix them, if they ever break. Or at least save the content you kid really really likes.

In the following weeks we are going to look into the following devices:

- Jooki
- Yoto mini
- Kekz Headphones
- Speakerbuddy

Stay tuned for more.
